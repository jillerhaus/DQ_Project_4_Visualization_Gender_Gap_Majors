# DataQuest Project 3: Visualizing Earnings Based on Majors

This is the fourth project in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. This is a very short project with a small scope. In it the gender distribution of different college majors is analyzed in the years from 1968 to 2010. The main focus is on using line plots to visualize trends over time and how plotting multiple plots can be used to compare different data points.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the jupyter notebook as well as the `CSV` file to run.
